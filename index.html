        The Principle of Mentalism:

    </h1>

<p>
    The Law of Mentalism states that the universe is mind, and all manifestation of events and things is the result of thought. 
    Every thought we have sets into motion the sequence that ultimately creates our life experience; thus, we are accountable for 
    what we both think and create. We could also refer to mentalism as the Law of Deliberate Intent for our thoughts are the deliberate 
    intentions of what we desire to create. It is vital that we take time to examine our thoughts, and correct erroneous, conditioned 
    beliefs that no longer support the experience for which we are longing.

    <h2>
    
        The Principle Of Vibration

    </h2>

    <p>

        The Law of Vibration affirms that everything is energy in motion and vibrating at various frequencies. 
        Nothing truly rests; even solid matter is vibrational energy at the subatomic level. The natural world consistently 
        mirrors to us the shifts in frequency to which our genetic design is sensing and responding. We are at every moment 
        receiving frequency signals from our environment, and transmitting the vibration of those messages back out into our 
        immediate world and the universe. Our quest to create a better world directly corresponds to the quality of our thoughts
        that determine the nature of our vibratory essence.
